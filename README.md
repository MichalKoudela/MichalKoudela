##                Hi, I'm Michal Koudela and here is few facts about me
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
- 💻 I'm a cyber serurity student in SSPSaG in Prague.
- 🔧 I focus on cryptography, programming, reverse engeneering and forensics.
- 📘 I've experience in these languages: C#
- 📕 Currently I am learning these languages: C++, C
- 🐧 Also, I use linux, but i do change distros, probably too often. I started at ***Kali*** tried ***Ubuntu*** (Never again)
now I'm using ***Debian***. 
    - This raises the question, but michael why don't you use Arch Linux ?
    - Easy answear because it is *waste of my time*. You have to set up arch for meaby too long and of course you have to update it regulary.
